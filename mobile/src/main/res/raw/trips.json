It was also the debut of Android Wear and Android TV.\n\nI have mainly attended to Android and Google Cloud Computing sessions. I used what I learned there to improve our Android App of the Day application with Material Design a few months later and we also started building a new iOS/Android application powered by a Google AppEngine scalable backend.",
